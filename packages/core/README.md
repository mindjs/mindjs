# Framework100500

Unopinionated, minimalistic pure `Node.js` API framework superpowered with _Dependency Injection_ (Inversion Of Control) features.


**Framework100500** is formerly inspired by _Angular_ and _Nest.js_. It is developed on top of the `injection-js` package extracted from Angular 4.x.


**Key features:**
* Pure Node.js. You don't need to transpile code and perform extra steps in your CI/CD pipeline. 
* Modular. You can easily split your codebase into small featured modules. 
* It is compatible with the most popular web frameworks such as Express.js, Koa.js, Restify, and others.
* HttpModule provides an ability to make external API calls, intercept them, and configure it depending on your needs.
* The testing module allows you to test your code in an easy and convenient way.
