# Mind.js

Unopinionated, minimalistic pure `Node.js` API framework superpowered with _Dependency Injection_ (Inversion Of Control) features.

**Key features:**
* Pure Node.js. You don't need to transpile your code and perform extra steps in your CI/CD pipeline. 
* Modular. You can easily split your codebase into small featured modules or even microservices.
* Dynamic Routing. You can build your dynamic routes before application has been run but after services are initialized.
* Dependency injection all around the app.
* No magic behind. You have complete control and understanding of what you do and what happens in your application.
* Easy to debug with standard Node.js inspection tools
* It is compatible with the most popular web frameworks such as `Express.js`, `Koa.js`, `Restify.js`, and others.
* `Mind.js` goes with `platform` support. You can use existing one as a super set of providers, which can be replaced with your custom ones. 
Furthermore, it is possible to setup you own platform.
* The`HttpModule` provides an ability to make external API calls, intercept them, and configure it depending on your needs.
* The `TestingModule` allows you to test your code in an easy and convenient way.
