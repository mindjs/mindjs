# Mind

Unopinionated, minimalistic pure `Node.js` API framework superpowered with _Dependency Injection_ (Inversion Of Control) features.


**Mind** is formerly inspired by _Angular_ and _Nest.js_. It is developed on top of the `injection-js` package extracted from Angular 4.x.


**Key features:**
* Pure Node.js. You don't need to transpile code and perform extra steps in your CI/CD pipeline. 
* Modular. You can easily split your codebase into small featured modules. 
* Dynamic Routing. You can build your dynamic routes before application is run but after services are initialized.
* Dependency injection all around the app.
* No magic behind. You have complete control and understanding what you do and what happens in application.
* It is compatible with the most popular web frameworks such as `Express.js`, `Koa.js`, `Restify.js`, and others.
* HttpModule provides an ability to make external API calls, intercept them, and configure it depending on your needs.
* The testing module allows you to test your code in an easy and convenient way.
